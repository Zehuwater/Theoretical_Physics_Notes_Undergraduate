# Theoretical_Physics_Notes_Undergraduate
HiÔºÅI'm a junior undergraduate student majoring in Mathematical Basic Science at Yunnan University. My research interests mainly focus on the theoretical physics, especially exploring the connections between physics at the smallest scales and the largest scales, or in the other words, partical physics and cosmology. This repository mainly records some of my physics major notes during my undergraduate years. Due to the formats of some of notes in Chinese, manuscripts, and PPTs, the PDF files presented in this repository are not complete. Your understanding is kindly requested.

During my first three years of undergraduate study (as I'm currently a junior), my main theoretical learning has included classical mechanics, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, solid state physics, general relativity, as well as quantum field theory which I studied on my own, and the gauge field theory and AdS/CFT that I am currently delving into.



Finally, I would like to express my gratitude for your visit to this repository. Also, this repository is being updated gradually. I will upload new files to you one by one as they are available. If you find anything inappropriate or incorrect, please feel free to contact me!
